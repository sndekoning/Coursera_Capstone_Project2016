### Introduction

This report will document the steps of the Coursera Data Specialization Capstone-project taken up until this point. The goal of this project is to build an English-language text prediction model based on three different english text-files and create a Shiny app which uses this model to give text suggestions in response to user input. 

### Data Description

To build this model, three different files, hereafter corpora, were used. One corpus with news messages, one with text from weblogs, and one with text from twitter messages. 

### Dependencies

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
